# HR

## What the application is about
Its an application for adding and managing information about new employees in a company. It is well suited for HR managers for capturing information about the employees when they join the company. You can edit, view as well as delete the records of employees. Its a full M.E.A.N(MongoDB, Express, Angular, NodeJS) CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) application which stores information in a NoSQL database, MongoDB. I wanted to combine my skills working with Angular with the new knowledge i have aquired about connecting NodeJS (Express) API with MongoDB database. The MongoDB database i used is the online hosted version, MongoDB Atlas. I only had prior knowledge of performing CRUD operations with PostgreSQL database. 

## Frontend technologies used
1. HTML5 - For the structure of the webpages.
2. SCSS - For styling the webpages such as background colors, hover effects, etc.
3. TypeScript - For adding functionality of buttons and logic to connect to ths database.
4. Tailwind CSS - For styling Daisy UI components and adding responsive behaviour for mobile devices.
5. Daisy UI - For adding fully functional components.
6. Angular - For coonecting to the MongoDB Backend API.

## Backend technolgies used
1. NodeJS - For connecting to the hosted MongoDB database.
2. JavaScript - For writing the logic of the Backend API.
3. MongoDB - To store data on Documents which are different from SQL tables and I used MongoDB Atlas since is hosted already as my intention is to host the application online as well.
